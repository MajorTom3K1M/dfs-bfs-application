# DFS-BFS Application

## Description

The **DFS-BFS Application** is a web application that visualizes the Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms through maze. This project is intended as a learning tool to help users understand how DFS and BFS work by providing an interactive and visual representation using JavaScript.

## Features

- **Algorithm Visualization**: Watch DFS and BFS algorithms solve the maze in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): JavaScript runtime environment.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): Web framework for Node.js.
- [Express-Handlebars](https://github.com/express-handlebars/express-handlebars): Template engine for Express applications.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/): JavaScript library for DOM manipulation and event handling.
